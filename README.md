# Natural-Language-Processing-Model-for-COVID-19-Research-Paper
This is a school project from the University of Toronto MIE 1624 Introduction to Data Science and Analytics. 

**Summary:**
In respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared a dataset of open sourced research papers. The goal of this project is to use NLP and other machine learning algorithms to develop a tool that can text-mine this dataset of research articles to gain useful insights about COVID-19 and how we might be able to tacke the outbreak, contain the spread, flatten the curve and improve vaccination efforts. 

**Objective:**
Use the dataset to better understand the transmission, and symptoms of COVID-19. Gain insights to better inform how our healthcare system, governments, industries can tackle the growing problem.
